# Cosmic-Asymmetry-Black-Hole-Model

This repository contains reproducible calculations and figures for a speculative black hole cosmology model that explains cosmic asymmetries (e.g., CMB dipole, galaxy spin preference, Hubble tension) without dark matter or energy. The model is based on Popławski's torsion bounce and inherited Kerr spin, verified with SymPy and tested against 2025 JWST/CMB data, as described in the paper:
"The Cosmic Asymmetry Black Hole Cosmological Model: An Alternative Approach to the Structure of the
Universe" by János Kevés – January 17, 2026.

Features 

Notebook: supplementary_calculations.ipynb – Reproduces model calculations, SymPy derivations, and figures.

Methods: Torsion bounce simulations, Kerr metric inheritance, asymmetry predictions.

Requirements: Python 3.x with SymPy, NumPy, Matplotlib (for figures).

Data: Based on public JWST/CMB datasets (links in notebook).

Runtime: Calculations run in ~5-10 minutes on a standard laptop.

Usage

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/janoscsabakeves-afk/cosmic-asymmetry-black-hole-model.git

Install dependencies: pip install sympy numpy matplotlib (or use requirements.txt if added).

Run the notebook sequentially in Jupyter. This is a work-in-progress repo. For full details, see paper.pdf.
